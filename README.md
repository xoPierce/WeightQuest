# WeightQuest

## Summary of the requirements and goals of the WeightQuest app. 
This app was created for the final project in the class CS360 - Mobile Architecture and Programming. The purpose of this app is to provide a tool that allows users to track their weight and set weight goals to hopefully improve their overall health and wellbeing. Some of the features that need to be included to achieve this goal include weight tracking, goal setting, goal notifications, and data visualization. The main components that need to be implemented within this app include:
-	Login screen that allows the user to login or create an account.
-	Screen with a table to view all the daily weights and goal weight.
-	Function to add a daily weight or a goal weight.
-	Notification system to notify the user when they have reached their goal.

## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
My app encompasses several screens, each tailored to fulfill various user needs and objectives. These screens comprise the login interface, account creation page, primary weight overview display, weight entry addition panel, and the goal setting screen. When conceptualizing the user interface (UI), my aim was to strike a balance between simplicity and an elegant, polished appearance.

Throughout the UI design process, I prioritized the user experience, envisioning the devices they are likely to use, selecting suitable color palettes, and optimizing the screen-to-screen navigation. This user-centric approach was fundamental in crafting an interface that seamlessly accommodates user interactions. As a result of these considerations, I am confident that my UI design achieved success by fostering effortless navigation, embracing minimalism, and exuding an overall sophisticated and streamlined ambiance, which collectively enhance the user engagement and satisfaction within my app.

## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
In approaching the coding process of my weight tracking app, I followed a structured and iterative approach. I began by breaking down the app's functionality into smaller modules and components. This allowed me to focus on developing individual features and ensuring their smooth integration into the overall app. Moreover, I embraced the concept of modular programming. By creating reusable and well-encapsulated code modules, I could enhance code maintainability and promote efficient development. This technique can be valuable in future projects to streamline development and minimize the risk of bugs.

## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
Thorough testing was a critical phase in ensuring the functionality and reliability of my weight tracking app. I primarily used manual testing due to the smaller scope of this project. For the manual testing, I systematically went through each feature, verifying inputs, outputs, and interactions to identify any potention problems. 

This testing process was vital as it revealed potential bugs, inconsistencies, and usability issues that might not have been evident during development. It allowed me to fine-tune the app's behavior, enhance user experience, and ultimately deliver a more robust product.

## Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
During the app's design and development process, a notable challenge I encountered was devising an intuitive and user-friendly interface for inputting and tracking weight data. To address this, I created an xml file that would serve as a single column in my weight entry grid. I really liked this method because I had full control over what each column would look like instead of a plain, generic looking table. I was able to keep the font, colors, theme, and overall feel consistent throughout the app. This innovation not only enhanced the app's visual appeal but also provided users with valuable insights into their progress, motivating them to maintain a healthier lifestyle.

## In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
In terms of modular coding, I organized the app's functionality into clearly defined reusable modules. This approach not only encourage efficient development but also laid the foundation for future enhancements and modifications. By demonstrating my skill in modular coding, I illustrated my ability to create a maintainable and extensible codebase that contributes to long-term app sustainability.

Furthermore, I carefully designed the user interface with a focus on simplicity and elegance, ensuring that users could seamlessly interact with the app. Through meticulous attention to color schemes, layout structures, and intuitive navigation, I successfully conveyed my ability to create an interface that enhances user engagement and satisfaction.

Together, the mastery of modular coding and the creation of a clean, user-centric UI serve as great examples of how I used my knowledge and skills to bring an attractive and functional mobile app to fruition.
